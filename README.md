### **Introduction**

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The discipline of computer science, artificial intelligence and linguistics that is concerned with the creation of computational models that process and understand natural language. These include: making the computer understand the semantic grouping of words (e.g. cat and dog are semantically more similar than cat and spoon), text to speech, language translation and many more

* **Sentiment Analysis:** It is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows organizations to identify public sentiment towards certain words or topics.
